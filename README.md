Exercises from "The C Programming Language, 2nt Ed." 
=====================================================



Basically just slowly going through the exercises in the book and keeping them here.

Update 2022:
I found this and I'm going through it again.  I lost some old progress but it's been 8 years so it won't hurt me to go through some things again.
For the most part I'm just typing in things from the book and adding comments to help me understand the code while reading and updating style to make code lint clean.
